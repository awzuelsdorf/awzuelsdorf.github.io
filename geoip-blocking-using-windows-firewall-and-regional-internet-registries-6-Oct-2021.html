			<p>This article will describe using data provided by the Regional Internet Registries (RIRs) APNIC and RIPE NCC to block IP addresses located in Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea. The method described here can be used to block any country whose IP address space is managed by APNIC or RIPE NCC, not just Russia, China, Iran, or North Korea.</p>
			<h2>Motivation: Why Block a Whole Country?</h2>
			<p>Blocking a whole country's IP address space can be useful when one has no legitimate reason to visit any website or access any resource within that country, either now or in the near future. For example, many Americans don't have any reason to go to a Russian, Chinese, Iranian, or North Korean website or otherwise access a computing resource in those countries. However, given that many unsophisticated but effective phishing schemes use servers located in another country to host fake login pages to steal passwords, allowing applications on your computer to make connections to computing resources within those countries can be unnecessary risk for no reward, especially in organizations with many users with differing technical skill levels. Therefore, it makes sense in many cases to block outbound connections (connections from your computer to another computing resource) and even inbound connections to a given country.</p>
			<h2>Getting the Data</h2>
			<p>The first step is to determine which IP address ranges correspond to which countries. There is no one place to find this data....FILL THIS OUT ANDY</p>
